                <p class="lh-lg fw-bolder fs-5">It is a very good place to sight the giant Salt Water Crocodile, some
                    growing to 23 feet in length, along
                    with other reptiles like the Water Monitor Lizard and the King Cobra. Spotted deers and wild boars
                    are
                    abundant in the park and can be spotted at all the major locations. Eight varieties of Kingfishers
                    are found
                    here and can be spotted along the many creeks and riverines within the park.
                    <br>
                    The boat ride from Khola to Dangmal or vice versa is highly recommended. Khola is one of the
                    gateways into
                    the park. This is along an artificial creek and it passes through dense mangrove forest providing a
                    glimpse
                    into the estuarine ecosystem and its wealth of fauna.Bhitarkanika has a very rich historical and
                    cultural past. It used to be the hunting grounds of the
                    erstwhile King of Kanika .It is also the home of medieval Hindu temples which can be
                    found dotted throughout the sanctuary. But the major attraction remains the wildlife wealth.

                    Barking deer, Chital, Wild Boar, Gaur and other wild animals. Consequently,

                    river mouth in the south. It is very famous for its nesting beach for olive ridley sea turtles. It
                    is one of the world's most important nesting beaches for turtles.
                    <br>
                    The Odisha coast has the world's largest known rookery of olive ridley sea turtle. Apart from
                    Gahirmatha rookery, two other masses are there where nesting beaches have been located which are at
                    the mouth of rivers Rushikulya and Devi. Olive ridley sea turtles feed on marine snails, smaller
                    forms of fish, fish eggs, crustaceans, and jellyfish. The algal material is also used as food by the
                    ridleys. Ridleys generally crush and grind the food materials before intaking.
                    <br>
                    Olive ridley sea turtles migrate in huge numbers from the beginning of November, every year, for
                    mating and nesting along the coast of Odisha. Gahirmatha coast has the annual nesting figure between
                    one hundred to five hundred thousand, each year.
