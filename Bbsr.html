                    Bhubaneswar derived its name from Tribhubaneswar, which literally means the Lord (Eeswar) of the Three World (Tribhuban), 
                    which refers to Shiva. Along with the old town, the present day Bhubaneswar has often been illustrated as the Ekamra Khetra (Temple City).
                    Although the modern city of Bhubaneswar was formally established only in 1948, the history of the areas in and around the present-day city 
                    can be traced to the 3rd century BCE and earlier. 
                    It is a confluence of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain heritage boasting of some of the finest Kalingan temples.

                    Not just in  architectural and infrastructural splendor, the place is also endowed with a green canopy of forests which makes it a haven for 
                    daredevil spirit in you to explore and the beasts in their wilderness.

                    During my short visit to Bhubaneswar, I had two visits to Bhubaneswar old town. Old town is the area
                     where original Bhubaneswar was centered around.There are more than 300 different temples in this part 
                    of the town. On day 01 evening, a friend, Debarpita Mohapatra, who was fellow blogger with meduring Tata
                     Nano superdrive 2010,  took me around and next day morning, I visited one more time to view the remaining 
                     important places.
                    <br>
                    Bhubaneswar's name originated from Tribhuvaneswar- meaning King of three worlds. The city has more than 300 
                    temples, if you exclude smaller ones. One of the reason for these many temples, as per my friend Debarpita is 
                    because there was a school teaching in temple construction and lots of temples were built as a practice.
                    <br>
                    Bhubaneshwar (also spelt Bhubaneswar, Bhubanesar, and Bhuvanesvar) is a city located in the Orissa district of 
                    north-eastern India and flourished as a centre of Hindu worship from the 7th century CE. Its mass of well-preserved 
                    sandstone temples, all oriented around the sacred lake Bindusarowar, make it one of the most impressive ancient temple
                     sites in the whole of India.
                    <br>

                    Orissan architecture greatly benefitted from a royal marriage between the Western Chalukya rulers and Orissan royalty
                     which brought to the region elements of Gupta architecture and its sophisticated temples. The Orissa then developed this 
                     canon into their own distinctive temple style. The oldest structures at Bhubaneswar are probably the three small Satrughnesvara 
                     shrines which are set in a line and date to perhaps the late 6th century CE.
