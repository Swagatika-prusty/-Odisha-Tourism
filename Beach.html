                    Jagannath temple is known as "Badadeula". Puri and the Jagannath Temple were invaded 18 times by Muslim
                    rulers, from the 7th century AD till the early 19th century with the objective of looting the treasures of
                    the temple. Odisha, including Puri and its temple, were part of British India from 1803 till India attained
                    independence in August 1947. Even though princely states do not exist in India today, the heirs of the House
                    of Gajapati still perform the ritual duties of the temple. The temple town has many Hindu religious mathas
                    or monasteries. <br>
                    Puri, located on the east coast of India on the Bay of Bengal, is in the centre of the Puri district. It is
                    delimited by the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, the Mauza Sipaurubilla on the west, Mauza Gopinathpur in
                    the north and Mauza Balukhand in the east. It is within the 67 kilometres (42 mi) coastal stretch of sandy
                    beaches that extends between Chilika Lake and the south of Puri city.

                <br>
                <b>Location: Gopalpur, Ganjam district, Odisha, India.</b>

                <p  class="lh-lg fw-bolder fs-5">Gopalpur is amongst the popular beaches in Orissa. Gopalpur-on-Sea is a beautiful and small beach resort
                    located along the Bay of Bengal in the eastern Indian state of Orissa. Gopalpur extends from latitude 19°16'
                    in the North to longitude 84°57' in the East. The place is 16 km away form Berhampur, on the Howrah-Chennai
                    main line.
                    <br>
                   
                    Being a beach resort, the place has a uniform temperature throughout the year. Temperature in the summer
                    months touches a high of 35°C and a low of 23°C, respectively. Winter months are relatively cold with a
                    maximum and minimum temperature of 27°C and 16°C, respectively. Average annual rainfall is 118.7 cm. Thus,
                    you may plan your trip to Gopalpur, beaches in Orissa accordingly.
                    <br>
                  
                    Gopalpur's importance dwindled when trade with Burma abruptly ceased during the war and never revived again.
                    When the British left India, even members of rich Bengali homes preferred to holiday in other places and
                    Gopalpur reverted to what it originally was, a fishing village.
        
                    With an increase in tourist trade in the late seventies, and the opening of luxury hotels, a slow revival
                    began and today Gopalpur-On-Sea is one of the foremost beach resorts in India. Though now there are many
                    popukar beaches in Orissa.

                <p class="lh-lg fw-bolder fs-5"> Chandipur beach is also called the ‘hide-and-seek’ beach, Chandipur Beach is a sprawling stretch of golden
                    sand surrounded by
                    Casuarina trees, pristine waters, and lush coastal vegetation. But a strange natural phenomenon occurs here
                    every day. Believe it or not, the sea water recedes up to 5 kilometres (3 miles), twice a day during
                    low-tide, leaving behind only the shells. The water returns during the high tide.
                    <br>
                  
                    Another interesting fact about Chandipur is that it is home to DRDO (Defence Research and Development
                    Organization) Integrated Research Range, where ballistic missiles are test-fired.
        
                    Chandipur Beach is also a great place to try some lip-smacking fresh seafood at one of the many restaurants
                    lining the beach.
