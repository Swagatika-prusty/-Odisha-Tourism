            Visits to the Sun Temple, Konark Museum, and Balukhand Sanctuary are a must, as is the ride to the Golden Beach in Puri which was recently re-certified as a Blue Flag Beach.

            Guests interested in art and crafts can visit Raghurajpur, a heritage crafts village where every household is an art gallery in itself. After a hectic day outdoors, 
            return to the luxurious campsite and unwind at a beach shack or retreat to the air-conditioned tent for an indulgent end to the day.
