            Summers in the city are pretty harsh with the scorching sun making any outdoor activity impossible,

            This is a great spot to spend an entire day with the complete family because it has lots of variety. Even though it isn't officially a water park in BBSR (short for Bhubaneswar), 
            you may still embrace a few fantastic water rides here. Aside from the coasters, the park features a nicely designed artificial lake where you may go paddle boating. 
            There's also a mini-golf course where both skilled and novice players may have a good time. You can always try your luck at golf here, whether you know how to play or not!
