                    The Jagannath Temple is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, believed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu,
                    originally built in 1198 BCE. The temple is not open to non-Hindus and is surrounded by two walls
                    and a 190-foot Shikhara which is mounted by Vishnu’s discus-shaped Sudarshan Chakra.
                    The presiding deity of the temple, Lord Jagannath is depicted in black with large white eyes,
                    the idol being tended to regularly by changing its clothes.
                    The temple also houses idols of Lord Jagannath’s sister Subhadra and brother Balbhadra.
                    <br>

                    The entry to the temple is free and jagannath temple darshan timings 05:00 am and 10:00 pm,
                    offering free darshan to all devotees. But if you wish to make a special puja booking,
                    you can do so directly off the temple ticket counter.

                    Puri is in the coastal delta of the Mahanadi River on the shores of the Bay of Bengal. In the
                    ancient days it was near to Sisupalgarh (also known as "Ashokan Tosali"). Then the land was drained
                    by a tributary of the Bhargavi River, a branch of the Mahanadi River. This branch underwent a
                    meandering course creating many arteries altering the estuary, and formed many sand hills. These
                    sand hills could be cut through by the streams. Because of the sand hills, the Bhargavi River,
                    flowing to the south of Puri, moved away towards the Chilika Lake. <br>
                    The beach at Puri, known as the "Ballighai beach, at the mouth of Nunai River", is 8 kilometres (5.0
                    mi) away from the town and is fringed by casurina trees.It has golden yellow sand. Sunrise and
                    sunset are pleasant scenic attractions here.Waves break in at the beach which is long and
                    wide.
