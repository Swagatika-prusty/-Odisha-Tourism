                    about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast from Puri city on the coastline in Puri district, Odisha,
                    India. The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty about
                    1250 CE.it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, who gather here every year for the
                    Chandrabhaga Mela around the month of February.
                    <br>
                    Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a
                    100-foot (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200
                    feet (61 m) high,[1][5] much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower
                    over the sanctuary; at one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains.<br>

                    Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or
                    Kalinga architecture.Theories range from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple in
                    the course of being sacked several times by Muslim armies between the 15th and 17th centuries.[1][7]
                    This temple was called the "Black Pagoda" in European sailor accounts as early as 1676 because it
                    looked like a great tiered tower which appeared black.
