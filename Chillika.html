                <p class="lh-lg fw-bolder fs-5">The vast and dream like Chilika Lagoon is situated on the east-coast of
                    India.
                    It is the largest brackish Water Lagoon with estuarine character that sprawls along the east coast.
                    It is the largest wintering ground for migratory waterfowl found anywhere on the Indian
                    sub-continent.
                    It is one of the hotspot of biodiversity in the country, and some rare,vulnerable and endangered
                    species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened Animals inhabit in the lagoon for atleast part of
                    their life cycle.
                    <br>
                    Chilika supports some of the largest congregation of migratory birds in the country, particularly
                    during the winter.
                    Flocks of migratory waterfowl arrive from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, Aral Sea, remote
                    parts of Russia, Kirghiz steppes of Mongolia,
                    Central and South East Asia, Ladakh and the Himalayas, to feed and breed in its fertile waters.
                    <br>

                    The best time to visit the Chilika Lake is the winter months of November to February, when the
                    variety of migratory birds can be witnessed.
                    Chilika Lake lives up to its reputation as the most picturesque spot and being Asia's largest
                    salt-water lagoon.<br>
                    A total of six species of dolphins — Irrawaddy, bottlenose, humpback, striped, finless and spinner
                    dolphins — have been recorded.

                    Chilika Lake is situated on the east coast of India in Odisha and is separated from the Bay of
                    Bengal by a small strip of land.
                    Chilika Lake spreads across the Khurda, Puri, and Ganjam districts of Odisha to the Daya river’s
                    mouth. It covers an area of around 1,100 square kilometres.<br>
                    This salt lake is home to millions of migratory birds and endangered plants and animals.
                    Tourists gather around the year to enjoy sighting Irrawaddy dolphins near Satpada Island.
                    This lagoon is divided into a central zone, southern zone, northern zone, and outer channel,
                    depending on the depth and salinity.<br>
                    Chilika Lake was declared Ramsar Convention Wetland of International Importance in India in 1981.
                    Nalaban, Birds Islands, Krushnaprasad, Somolo, and Kalijai are some of the prominent islands in the
                    lagoon.
                    Nalaban Island and Chilika Lake bird sanctuary were protected under the Wildlife Protection Act,
                    1972.<br>
                    This lake has been prioritised for conservation and management under the Mangroves and Coral Reefs
                    Committee of the Ministry of Environment & Forests and the Central Government of India.
                    Chilika Lake is an income source for more than 0.2 million fisherfolk and the livelihood of several
                    nearby villages.

                    Kalijai Temple is located on an island in Chilika Lake.It is considered to be the temple of Goddess
                    Kalijai. Goddess Kalijai is actually Jai,who was coming to Parikud to marry Raja's son.A severe
                    storm came and the boat crashed here.
                    2 boat drivers and their father survived and Kalijai died. After death, Jai came in his
                    father-in-law's dream and said, "I will stay here, build my temple here, I will be worshiped here."
                    The island provides an excellent destination for pilgrims as well as tourists. Every year in
                    January, a big fair is held during the festival of Makar Sankranti.<br>
                    Chilika lake, which is a major tourist attraction for its Irrawaddy dolphins, saw the numbers of its
                    flagship aquatic animal drop sharply from 162 in 2021 to 151 this year. There has also been a fall
                    in the number of bottlenose dolphins at Chilika, from 26 in 2021 to 16 in 2022.<br>
