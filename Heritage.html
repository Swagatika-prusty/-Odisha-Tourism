            only recorded history of era that is still shrouded in mystery. Built somewhere
            around the 2nd century BC by King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty, these ancient
            rock cut caves were first discovered by a young British Officer Andrew Sterling in the 19th century AD.
            <br>
           
            Hathigumpha : or the elephant cave as its known bears the inscriptions of King Kharavela.

                ASI (Archaeological Survey of India). As you enter the cave complex you can go in various
                directions as the caves are all spread out. The numbering of the caves is also not in any 
                particular order. The map at the entrance gives you the position of caves but it’s a bit tricky
                to find out their exact location in reality.
                <br>

                Rani Gumpha :To reach this cave you have to take the right path as you enter Udayagiri. 
                This is the largest cave complex and one of the most beautiful ones. 
                This cave has multiple sections and is on two floors.
                
                <br>
                Chotho Hanthi Gumpha :As the name suggests this cave has an elephant cut out on the front.
                The single cave has a huge rock bolder on top. Pillars were later added to support the top weight.
                Alkapuri Gumpha :This is a double-storied cave. The lower section is simple with just one chamber
                and two stone pillars. The upper section is single-chambered with stone pillars.</p>

            that lets you know about the enormous battles that were fought here, the Kalinga War of 261 B.C.

            diehard Buddha devotee who eventually followed the preaching of Buddha for the rest of his life.
            <br>

            Dhauli is famous for the edicts related to Buddhism that were composed from the Brahmi script
            and used Prakrit language. One can spot a series of rock cut monuments at this hill.
           <br>
            An enormous temple in Dhauli is the Dhavaleswar Temple, which is much frequented by the 
            visitors. In addition to this, you have the Bahirangeswar Temple Siva Temple as well as
            the Ganesha Temple that together add to the religious aspect to this place.</p>
