        <p class="lh-lg fw-bolder fs-5">Mahendragiri is associated with the Ramayana as Mahendra
             Parvata (mountain). It is a 'Kula Parvata'along with Malaya, Sahyadri, Parijatra,
              Shuktiman, Vindhya and Malyavaan. 
              <br>
            Mahendragiri is an undeveloped but beautiful Hill Station in Odisha. The roads are not so 
            good, so go prepared accordingly. There is no accommodation here. 
            Not a family tour destination. My friends and I camped on top of the mountain.
            <br>
        
            Mahendragiri is a hill station located in the Paralakhemundi subdivision of the district of Gajapati in Orissa.
            A part of the Eastern Ghats, the mountain peak is worth a visit for the views if not for the sights, sounds and culture on offer.
