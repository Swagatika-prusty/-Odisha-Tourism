                <p class="lh-lg fw-bolder fs-5">Nicco Park is an amusement park preferred mostly for a quick getaway in
                    the city. It was created in India in association with Nicco Japan.
                    The place has beautifully landscaped gardens and areas designated for a number of interesting rides
                    and kiosks to suit the customer's preference
                    <br>
                    Nicco Park, with its 25 acres of land, is a comprehensive amusement zone where you may have a good
                    time all day long, and your soul will want to keep going.
                    Since 1998, this contemporary amusement park has been serving Bhubaneswar's adrenaline junkies.
                    <br>

                    This is a great spot to spend an entire day with the complete family because it has lots of variety.
                    Even though it isn't officially a water park in BBSR (short for Bhubaneswar),
                    you may still embrace a few fantastic water rides here. Aside from the coasters, the park features a
                    nicely designed artificial lake where you may go paddle boating.

                <p class="lh-lg fw-bolder fs-5">The vast and dream like Chilika Lagoon is situated on the east-coast of
                    India.
                    It is the largest brackish Water Lagoon with estuarine character that sprawls along the east coast.
                    It is the largest wintering ground for migratory waterfowl found anywhere on the Indian
                    sub-continent.
                    It is one of the hotspot of biodiversity in the country, and some rare,vulnerable and endangered
                    species listed in the IUCN Red List of threatened Animals inhabit in the lagoon for atleast part of
                    their life cycle.
                    <br>
                    Chilika supports some of the largest congregation of migratory birds in the country, particularly
                    during the winter.
                    Flocks of migratory waterfowl arrive from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, Aral Sea, remote
                    parts of Russia, Kirghiz steppes of Mongolia,
                    Central and South East Asia, Ladakh and the Himalayas, to feed and breed in its fertile waters.
                    <br>

                    The best time to visit the Chilika Lake is the winter months of November to February, when the
                    variety of migratory birds can be witnessed.
                    Chilika Lake lives up to its reputation as the most picturesque spot and being Asia's largest
                    salt-water lagoon.
